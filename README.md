------------------------------ Prediction of survival of titanic ------------------------------------ 
It is a project of finding the probability of survival in ship
1. In this project we analyse the data and checking the major factors of survival such as age, sex, fare paid by costumers.
2. And after fitting the data to the algorithm, we analyse that our project show a good accuracy in predicting the survival rate of passengers in Titanic.



----------------------------- Predicting the price of houses -----------------------------------------
Using Linear Regression model we predict the price of new house after knowing the data of nearby houses.
Using data of nearby houses as features and fit that data to the linear regression model to train and then predict the data of a new houses.
